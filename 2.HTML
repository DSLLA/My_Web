You don't need to be a programmer or a CS major to understand the CSS specifications.</a><br>
You don't need to be over 18 or have a Bachelor's degree.<br> You just need to be very pedantic, very persistent, and very thorough.<br>A specification is not a manual. <br>There is no excuse for badly written prose and please complain if you find some.<br>But specs do target a specific audience.
